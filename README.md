- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @errormagnet.
- I am a Software Engineer currently open to work. I have almost three years of software development experience. I have worked mostly with Javascript and Rails. I have done various freelance/hobby projects using flutter and have a keen interest in expanding my knowledge of web and app development. I have a good knowledge of UX/UI as well to be able to understand the entire product development process in a granular level and also be able to have an input in every step.
- ðŸŒ± I am currently learning React.
